zptaksand
=========

A sandbox for uploading a client created repo

This is a sandbox which selfproved that you can start a repo from scratch
and then later share on github

The repo was created by the following commands

mkdir zptaksand
git init
git add.
git commit -a -m "initial commit"

a separate branch was also created, merged and then deleted
before the repository was created  and then the following commands issued

git remote add origin https://github.com/mjptak/zptaksand.git
git push -u origin master

note that the master branch is created automatically with the first commit
